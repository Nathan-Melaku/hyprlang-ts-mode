Hyprlang Tree-Sitter Mode is a major mode designed to provide enhanced
editing support for Hyprland configuration files in Emacs. By
leveraging Tree-Sitter, this mode offers syntax highlighting
and indentation, navigation, and imenu support.

[!NOTE]

This package is based on Emacs 29's built-in =treesit=. And it
requires a tree-sitter-hyprlang grammer.  The package has been tested
with version 3.0.0 of the tree-sitter-hyprlang grammer.

** Features
Currently, this mode provides the following features:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Proper Indentation Support
- Navigation
- Imenu

** Requirements
To use Hyprlang Tree-Sitter Mode, youâ€™ll need the following:

- Emacs 29+ compiled with tree-sitter support
- A compatible Tree-Sitter grammar for Hyprland configuration
  files. You can find the grammer [[https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-hyprlang][HERE]]. For more info look at the
  installation section below.

** Installation
Follow these steps to install Hyprlang Tree-Sitter Mode:

1. Get the hyprlang tree-sitter grammer: you can do this by adding the
   tree-sitter grammer url to the =treesit-language-source-alist= alist

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist
             '(hyprlang "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-hyprlang"))
   #+end_src

   Then =M-x= =treesit-install-language-grammar= =RET=. Then select
   hyperlang from the list and press =RET=. This will install the
   hyperlang tree-sitter grammer.

2. Install the hyprlang-ts-mode:
   =hyperlang-ts-mode= is available from [[https://melpa.org/#/hyprlang-ts-mode][MELPA]]. You can install it directly via
   =M-x package-install RET hyprlang-ts-mode RET=, after [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][Enabling Melpa]].

** Configuration
Indentation offset can be configured through a custom variable called
=hyprlang-ts-mode-indent-offset=. By default it is set to 2 you can
change it to the value that suits you.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hyprlang-ts-mode
    :ensure t
    :custom
    (hyprlang-ts-mode-indent-offset 4)
#+end_src

** Usage
=C-M-a= and =C-M-e= will navigate to the begining and end of
sections. Imenu will show a list of sections available in the buffer.
