Hyprlang Tree-Sitter Mode is a major mode designed to provide enhanced editing support for Hyprland configuration files in Emacs. By leveraging Tree-Sitter, this mode offers robust syntax highlighting and indentation features, with plans to expand its capabilities in the future.

[!NOTE]

This package is based on Emacs 29's built-in =treesit=. And it requires a tree-sitter-hyprlang grammer.
The package has been tested with version 3.0.0 of the tree-sitter-hyprlang grammer.

** Features
Currently, this mode provides the following features:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Proper Indentation Support
- Navigation
- Imenu

More features are planned for future releases.

** Requirements
To use Hyprlang Tree-Sitter Mode, youâ€™ll need the following:

- Emacs 29+ compiled with tree-sitter support
- A compatible Tree-Sitter grammar for Hyprland configuration files. You can find one [[https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-hyprlang][Hyprlang tree-sitter grammer]].

** Installation
Follow these steps to install Hyprlang Tree-Sitter Mode:

1. Get the hyprlang tree-sitter grammer:
   you can do this by adding the tree-sitter grammer url to the treesit-language-source-alist alist

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist
             '(hyprlang "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-hyprlang"))
   #+end_src

   Then =M-x= =treesit-install-language-grammar= =RET=. Then select hyperlang from the list and press =RET=. This
   will install the hyperlang tree-sitter grammer.

2. Install the hyprlang-ts-mode:
   you can do this using straight as follows

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package hyprlang-ts-mode
       :straight (:type git :host github :repo "Nathan-Melaku/hyprlang-ts-mode"))
   #+end_src

** Configuration
Indentation offset can be configured through a custom variable called =hyprlang-ts-mode-indent-offset=. By default
it is set to 2 you can change it to the value that suits you.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hyprlang-ts-mode
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "Nathan-Melaku/hyprlang-ts-mode")
    :custom
    (hyprlang-ts-mode-indent-offset 4)
#+end_src

** Usage
=C-M-a= and =C-M-e= will navigate to the begining and end of sections. Imenu will show a list of sections available in the buffer.
